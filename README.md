# CS320Final


How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

  The advantage of writing programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable is that they can be used in a variety of applications. It allows for modules to be interconneccted as need for them arises. The CRUD module is a great example, as it can be used in most any application of database manipulation.


How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

  My approach for problems is to break down a problem into its most basic parts. With these parts on display I can then mold a solution that will fulfill the needs of the user completely. This assignment saw me putting an emphasis on how the data was interacted with, then displaying it neatly. The best technique of this project was the CRUD module and its diversity.

What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

  Computer Scientists help with problems that would take too many people too much time to complete. This project and others like it are created to make the long laborious tasks a minor stepping stone in the path of a companies goals.
